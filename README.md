# Tool-Aware AI Testing Framework

Welcome to the **Tool-Aware AI Testing Framework**, an open-source repository dedicated to exploring and optimizing tool selection in AI agents. This repository serves as the official codebase for the accompanying research paper, providing a foundation for replicating experiments, validating findings, and building on the proposed methodologies.

> üöß **Work In Progress**: This project is under active development. Expect frequent updates and enhancements as we refine the framework and experiments.

## üìö About the Project

Tool-aware AI agents are transforming industries by leveraging external tools (e.g., APIs, databases) to perform tasks more effectively. However, the decision-making process behind selecting the right tool for the right task remains a key challenge.

This project focuses on:

- Evaluating how prompts, metadata, and agent decision-making techniques influence tool selection.
- Simulating multi-tool environments for real-world tasks like summarization, retrieval, coding, and more.
- Testing the impact of **model selection** on agent behavior and tool decisions.
- Providing insights into optimizing AI agents for efficiency, accuracy, and alignment with user intent.

The repository complements the research paper by offering an open-source implementation of the experiments, analyses, and techniques described.
